You can add a new theme settings by going onto settings schema .json

{
    "name": "Shopping Cart",
    "settings": [
      {
        "type": "header",
        "content": "Shopping Cart"
      }
    ]
  },


This is the synax to create a header for shopping cart

{
    "name": "Shopping Cart",
    "settings": [
      {
        "type": "header",
        "content": "Shopping Cart"
      },
      {
        "type" : "text",
        "id" : "test_data",
        "label" : "Test Data"
      }
    ]
  },

  This shows a header with Shopping Cart
   but if you click inside it shows a text box with the label test data
   make sure to save after adding the new data point

To write down any data point added you can go to profile.liquid or theme.liquid to add the data 
{{settings.test_data}}

It is also saved in settings_data.json


https://laravel-mix.com/docs/6.0/installation

npm init -y

npm install laravel-mix --save-dev

add src and js and app.js and scss and app.scss

also add let mix = require('laravel-mix');

mix.js('src/app.js', 'dist').setPublicPath('dist');

added an alert to app.js - testing purposes

npx mix

This basically makes the local variables at src "global" as its a bundle and it goes to the assets file
